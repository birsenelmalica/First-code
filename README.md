Welkome to the Hicoders!

First, I created a file called sites.
I created the file named Project with the mkdir command.
I went to the Project folder with the cd command.
I created a folder named Hicoders with the mkdir command.
I went to the Hicoders folder with the cd command.
I created the Preperation and Css folders with the mkdir command.
I went to the Preparation folder with the cd command.
I created three folders named Researches, Sildes and MyNotes.
I went to the MyNotes folder with the cd command.
I created the Lecture.01.txt file with the touch command.
I went to the Lecture.01.txt file with the cd command.Then I wrote the welcome to Hicoders with the command cat >Lecture.01.txt.
